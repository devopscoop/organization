[Statement 1]: Terraform repos should each have their own bucket.
    + <granularity>: We can only have granular access control if we have separate buckets.
      - <bucket permissions>: we can put permissions on buckets
    - <too many buckets>: creating a bucket per repo will create too many buckets.
