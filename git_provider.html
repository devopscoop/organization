        <p>GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg are three major git-based platforms suitable for hosting decentralized, free, open source projects. Each has a unique philosophy, feature set, and community focus, which may impact your decision depending on project needs for decentralization, privacy, and sustainability.</p>

        <h2 class="">GitHub</h2>
        <p class="">GitHub offers the largest developer community, seamless GitHub Actions CI/CD, and great discoverability, but is highly centralized (controlled by Microsoft), mixing FOSS and proprietary business models. It's ideal for exposure but less philosophically decentralized.</p>
        <h2 class="">GitLab</h2>
        <p class="">GitLab is highly flexible: you can use its cloud or self-host your own instance (with Forgejo or Gitea for extra decentralization). CI/CD is robust, permissions are granular, and it's more open source friendly, though the main hosted service is for-profit.</p>
        <h2 class="">Codeberg</h2>
        <p class="">Codeberg is a nonprofit, FOSS-driven platform based on Gitea, promoting true decentralization via federation and ethical standards. There's no tracking or ads, making it suitable for privacy-conscious projects. The community is smaller and less discoverable than GitHub.</p>
        <h2 class="">Best Choice for Decentralized FOSS Projects</h2>
        <p class="">For those who prioritize decentralization, privacy, no vendor lock-in, and nonprofit hosting, <strong>Codeberg is the most philosophically aligned</strong>-offering FOSS infrastructure, federated collaboration, no ads, and ethical stewardship. For maximum exposure and world-class CI/CD, GitHub is a strong secondary choice. GitLab provides flexibility if you plan to run your own instance or want integrated DevOps features.</p>
        <p class=""><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="">
            <p class=""><strong>Most decentralized and ethical:</strong> Codeberg</p>
          </li>
          <li class="">
            <p class=""><strong>Best for discoverability:</strong> GitHub</p>
          </li>
          <li class="">
            <p class=""><strong>Best for custom workflows or self-hosting:</strong> GitLab</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="">Each platform supports free open source hosting, but the best fit depends on your project's values and requirements. For a truly decentralized, free, open source project, Codeberg stands out as the leading option.</p>
