## On privacy

- Services should enforce anonymity to protect users.
- Anonymous accounts must not have usernames or profile pictures, or they become pseudonymous.
- Services that must comply with know your customer (KYC) regulations should still enforce anonymity between users if possible.
- If pseudonymity is required:
    - Pseudonymous accounts should have usernames and profile pictures to make them easy to identify.
    - Usernames and profile pictures should be randomly generated, to prevent users from doxxing themselves.
    - Generated usernames should be human-readable, not random strings of alphanumberic characters.
    - Profile pictures should be randomly generated with https://jdenticon.com/. As a bonus, generated profile pics take up far less space than saving user created profile pictures.

- TODO: Should users be allowed to generate new random usernames and profile pictures?
